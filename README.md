# FLASK_PROJECT
We want to provide a website that allows you to search for used cars that fit your request.

This Python project is a web application built using the Flask framework. It utilizes Beautiful Soup for web scraping purposes, allowing users to extract data from specific websites and store it in a structured format. The application has several routes that handle HTTP requests and return the scraped data to the user. In addition to using Flask and Beautiful Soup, the project also employs procedural programming techniques to organize and manipulate the data as needed.
